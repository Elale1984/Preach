                "1. When God was about to lead the Israelites out of Egypt, he commanded, shortly before their departure, that they should eat the Passover the night they started; and as a perpetual memorial of their redemption, they were annually, on the recurrence of the season, to celebrate the feast of Easter for seven days. A specially urgent feature of the command was that on the first evening of the feast they must put out of their houses all leaven and leavened bread, and during the seven days eat none but the unleavened bread, or cakes. Hence the evangelists speak of the feast as the Feast (or Days) of Unleavened Bread. Mr 14:1; Lu 22:1.\n" +
                        "\n" +
                        "2. Paul, in this lesson, explains the figure in brief but beautiful and expressive words. He is prompted to introduce the subject by the fact that in the preceding verses of this chapter he has been reproving the Corinthians for their disposition to boast of the Gospel and of Christ while abusing such liberty unto unchastity and other sins. He admonishes them that, possessing the Gospel and having become Christians, they ought, as becomes Christians, to live according to the Gospel, avoiding everything not consistent with the faith and with Christian character--everything not befitting them as new creatures.\n" +
                        "\n" +
                        "3. So the apostle uses the figure of the Paschal lamb and unleavened bread requisite at the Jews' Feast of the Passover, in his effort to point the Corinthians to the true character and purpose of the New Testament made with us in the kingdom of Christ. He explains what is the true Paschal Lamb and what the unleavened bread, and how to observe the real Passover, wherein all must be new and spiritual. In the joy and wealth of his mind he presents this analogy to remind them that they are Christians and to consider what that means.\n" +
                        "\n" +
                        "His meaning is: Being Christians and God's true people, and called upon to observe a Passover, you must go about it in the right way, putting away from you all remaining leaven until it shall have been purged out utterly.\n" +
                        "\n" +
                        "What Paul means by \"leaven\" is told later in his phrase \"neither with the leaven of malice and wickedness\"; he means whatever is evil and wicked. Everything foreign to Christianity in both doctrine, or faith, and life, is \"leaven.\" From all this Paul would have Christians purge themselves with the same thoroughness with which the leaven was to be put away from their Easter according to the law. And, holding to the figure, he would have us observe our Passover in the use of the sweet bread, which, in distinction from the leaven, signifies sincerity and truth, or a nature and life completely new.\n" +
                        "\n" +
                        "4. The text, then, is but an admonition to upright Christian works, directed to those who have heard the Gospel and learned to know Christ. This is what Paul figuratively calls partaking of the true unleavened bread--or wafers or cakes. We Germans have borrowed our word \"cakes\" from the phraseology of the Jewish Church, abbreviating \"oblaten,\" wafers, into \"fladen,\" or cakes. How else should we gentiles get the idea of cakes on Easter, when at our Passover we, by faith, eat the Paschal Lamb, Christ? We are admonished to partake of the true unleavened bread that life and conduct may accord with faith in Christ, whom we have learned to know. Paul's admonition begins: \"Know ye not that a little leaven leaveneth the whole lump?\"\n" +
                        "\n" +
                        "5. This by way of introducing the succeeding admonitions. Leaven is a common figure with the apostle, one he uses frequently, almost proverbially; employing it, too, in his epistle to the Ga 5:9). Christ, also, gives us a Scripture parable of the leaven. Mt 13:33. It is the nature of leaven that a small quantity mixed with a lump of dough will pervade and fill the whole lump until its own acid nature has been inparted to it. This Paul makes a figure of spiritual things as regards both doctrine and life.\n" +
                        "\n" +
                        "6. In Ga 5:9 he makes it more especially typify false doctrine. For it is just as true that the introduction of an error in an article of faith will soon work injury to the whole and result in the loss of Christ. Thus it was with the Galatians. The one thing insisted upon by the false apostles was circumcision, though they fully intended to preach the Gospel of Christ. Such innovation will pursue its course with destructive sweep until even the uncontaminated part becomes worthless; the once pure mass is wholly corrupted. The apostle writes to the Ga 5:2): \"Behold, I Paul say unto you, that, if ye receive circumcision, Christ will profit you nothing.\" Again (verse 4), \"Ye are severed from Christ--ye are fallen away from grace.\"\n" +
                        "\n" +
                        "But in this text he has reference more particularly to an erroneous idea concerning life and conduct. In this instance it is likewise true that, once the flesh be allowed any license, and liberty be abused, and that under the name of the Gospel, there is introduced a leaven which will speedily corrupt faith and conscience, and continue its work until Christ and the Gospel are lost. Such would have been the fate of the Corinthians had not Paul saved them from it by this epistle admonishing and urging them to purge out the leaven of license; for they had begun to practice great wantonness, and had given rise to sects and factions which tended to subvert the one Gospel and the one faith.\n" +
                        "\n" +
                        "7. This is, then, wise counsel and serious admonition, that faithful guard be maintained against the infusion or introduction into doctrine of what is false, whether it pertains to works or faith. The Word of God, faith and conscience are very delicate things. The old proverb says: \"Non patitur jocum fama, fides, oculus;\"--Good reputation, faith and the eye--these three will bear no jest.\n" +
                        "\n" +
                        "Just as good wine or precious medicines are corrupted by a single drop of poison or other impurity, and the purer they are, the more readily defiled and poisoned; so, also, God's Word and his cause will bear absolutely no alloy. God's truth must be perfectly pure and clear, or else, it is corrupt and unprofitable. And the worst feature of the matter is, the sway and intrenchment of evil is so strong that it cannot be removed; just as leaven, however small the quantity, added to the lump of dough, soon penetrates and sours the whole lump, while it is impossible to arrest its influence or once more to sweeten the dough.\n" +
                        "\n" +
                        "8. The proposal of certain wise minds to mediate, and effect a compromise, between us and our opponents of the Papacy, is wrong and useless. They would permit preaching of the Gospel but at the same time retain the Papistical abuses, advocating that these errors be not all censured and rejected, because of the weak; and that for the sake of peace and unity we should somehow moderate and restrict our demands, each party being ready to yield to the other and patiently bear with it. While in such case no perfect purity can be claimed to exist, the situation can be made endurable if discretion is used and trouble is taken to explain.\n" +
                        "\n" +
                        "Nay, not so! For, as you hear, Paul would not mix even a small quantity of leaven with the pure lump, and God self has urgently forbidden it. The slight alloy would thoroughly penetrate and corrupt the whole. Where human additions are made to the Gospel doctrine in but a single point, the injury is done; truth is obscured and souls are led astray. Therefore, such mixture, such patchwork, in doctrine is not to be tolerated. As Christ teaches (Mt 9:16), we must not put new cloth upon an old garment.\n" +
                        "\n" +
                        "9. Nor may we in our works and in our daily life tolerate the yielding to the wantonness of the flesh and at the same boast the Gospel of Christ, as did the Corinthians, who stirred up among themselves divisions and disorder, even to the extent of one marrying his stepmother. In such matters as these, Paul says, a little leaven leavens and ruins the whole lump--the entire Christian life. These two things are not consistent with each other: to hold to the Christian faith and to live after the wantonness of the flesh, in sins and vices condemned by the conscience. Paul elsewhere warns (1Co 6:9-10): \"Be not deceived: neither fornicators, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor effeminate, nor abusers of themselves with men, nor thieves, nor covetous, nor drunkards, nor revilers, nor extortioners, shall inherit the kingdom of God.\" Again (Ga 5:19-21): \"The works of the flesh are manifest . . . of which I forewarn you, even as I did forewarn you, that they who practice such things shall not inherit the kingdom of God.\"\n" +
                        "\n" +
                        "10. Warrant is given here likewise for censuring and restraining the rash individuals who assert that men should not be terrified by the Law, nor surrendered to Satan. No! it is our duty to teach men to purge out the old leaven; we must tell them they are not Christians, but devoid of the faith, when they yield to the wantonness of the flesh and wilfully persevere in sin against the warning of conscience. We should teach that such sins are so much the more vicious and damnable when practiced under the name of the Gospel, under cover of Christian liberty; for that is despising and blaspheming the name of Christ and the Gospel: and therefore such conduct must be positively renounced and purged out, as irreconcilable with faith and a good conscience.\n" +
                        "\n" +
                        "\"Purge out the old leaven, that ye may be a new lump, even as ye are unleavened.\"\n" +
                        "\n" +
                        "11. If we are to be a new, sweet lump, Paul says, we must purge out the old leaven. For, as stated, a nature renewed by faith and Christianity will not admit of our living as we did when devoid of faith and in sin, under the influence of an evil conscience. We cannot consistently be \"a new lump\" and partake of the Passover, and at the same time permit the old leaven to remain: for if the latter be not purged out, the whole lump will be leavened and corrupted; our previous sinful nature will again have supremacy and overthrow the faith, the holiness upon which we have entered and a good conscience.\n" +
                        "\n" +
                        "12. Paul does not here speak of leaven in general; he commands to purge out the \"old leaven,\" implying there may be good leaven. Doubtless he is influenced by respect for the words of the Lord Christ where (Mt 13:33) he likens the kingdom of heaven also to leaven. In this latter case leaven cannot be bad in quality; rather, the object in mixing it with the lump is to produce good, new bread. Reference is to the Word of God, or the preaching of the Gospel, whereby we are incorporated into the kingdom of Christ, or the Christian Church. Though the Gospel appears to be mean, is despicable and objectionable to the world, yet such is its power that wherever introduced it spreads, finding disciples in whom it works; it transforms them, giving to them its own properties, even as leaven imparts its powers to the dough and causes it to rise.\n" +
                        "\n" +
                        "But Paul refers here to old, inactive and worthless leaven. He means teachings, views, or manner of life resulting from the Old Adam, from flesh and blood, and destructive of the pure, new doctrine, or a nature renewed by Christianity. Later on he terms it the \"leaven of malice and wickedness,\" and in the verse under consideration bids the Corinthians be a new, pure lump.\n" +
                        "\n" +
                        "13. Note the apostle's peculiar words. He enjoins purging out the old leaven, assigning as reason the fact: Ye are a new and unleavened lump. By a new unleavened lump he means that faith which clings to Christ and believes in the forgiveness of sin through him; for he immediately speaks of our Passover: Christ, sacrificed for us. By this faith the Corinthians are now purified from the old leaven, the leaven of sin and an evil conscience, and have entered upon the new life; yet they are commanded to purge out the old leaven.\n" +
                        "\n" +
                        "14. Now, how shall we explain the fact that he bids them purge out the old leaven that they may be a new lump, when at the same time he admits them to be unleavened and a new lump? How can these Corinthians be as true, unleavened wafers, or sweet dough, when they have yet to purge out the old leaven?\n" +
                        "\n" +
                        "This is an instance of the Pauline and apostolic way of speaking concerning Christians and the kingdom of Christ; it shows us what the condition really is. It is a discipline wherein a new, Christian life is entered upon through faith in Christ the true Passover; hence, Easter is celebrated with sweet, unleavened bread. But at the same time something of the old life remains, which must be swept out, or purged away. However, this latter is not imputed, because faith and Christ are there, constantly toiling and striving to thoroughly purge out whatever uncleanness remains.\n" +
                        "\n" +
                        "15. Through faith we have Christ and his purity perfectly conferred upon ourselves, and we are thus regarded pure; yet in our own personal nature we are not immediately made wholly pure, without sin or weakness. Much of the old leaven still remains, but it will be forgiven, not be imputed to us, if only we continue in faith and are occupied with purging out that remaining impurity.\n" +
                        "\n" +
                        "This is Christ's thought when he says to his disciples (Joh 15:3), \"Already ye are clean because of the word which I have spoken unto you,\" and in the same connection he declares that the branches in him must be purged that they may bring forth more fruit. And to Peter-- and to others he says (Joh 13:10), \"He that is bathed needeth not save to wash his feet, but is clean every whit: and ye are clean, but not all.\" These passages, as is also stated elsewhere, teach that a Christian by faith lays hold upon the purity of Christ, for which reason he is also regarded pure and begins to make progress in purity; for faith brings the Holy Spirit, who works in man, enabling him to withstand and to subdue sin.\n" +
                        "\n" +
                        "16. They are to be censured according to whose representations and views a Christian Church is to be advocated which should be in all respects without infirmity and defect, and who teach that, when perfection is not in evidence, there is no such thing as the Church of Christ nor as true Christians. Many erring spirits, especially strong pretenders to wisdom, and precocious, self-made saints, immediately become impatient at sight of any weakness in Christians who profess the Gospel faith; for their own dreams are of a Church without any imperfections, a thing impossible in this earthly life, even they themselves not being perfect.\n" +
                        "\n" +
                        "17. Such, we must know, is the nature of Christ's office and dominion in his Church that though he really does instantaneously, through faith, confer upon us his purity, and by the Spirit transforms our hearts, yet the work of transformation and purification is not at once completed. Daily Christ works in us and purges us, to the end that we grow in purity daily. This work he carries on in us through the agency of the Word, admonishing, reproving, correcting and strengthening; as in the case of the Corinthians through the instrumentality of Paul. Christ also uses crosses and afflictions in effecting this end.\n" +
                        "\n" +
                        "He did not come to toil, to suffer and to die because he expected to find pure and holy people. Purity and holiness for us he has acquired in his own person to perfection, inasmuch as he was without sin and perfectly pure from the moment he became man, and this purity and holiness he communicates to us in their flawless perfection in so far our faith clings to him. But to attain personal purity of such perfection requires a daily effort on the part of Christ, until the time shall have come that he has wrought in us a flawless perfection like his own.\n" +
                        "\n" +
                        "So he has given us his Word and his Spirit to aid us in purging out the remaining old leaven, and in holding to our newly-begun purity instead of lapsing from it. We must retain the faith, the Spirit and Christ; and this, as before said, we cannot do if we give place to the old carnal disposition instead of resisting it.\n" +
                        "\n" +
                        "18. Note, one thing the text teaches: Even the saints have weakness, uncleanness and sin yet to be purged out, but it is not imputed unto them because they are in Christ and occupied in purging out the old leaven.\n" +
                        "\n" +
                        "19. Another thing, it teaches what constitutes the difference between the saints and the unholy, for both are sinful; it tells the nature of sins despite the presence of which saints and believers are holy, retaining grace and the Holy Spirit, and also what sins are inconsistent with faith and grace.\n" +
                        "\n" +
                        "20. The sins remaining in saints after conversion are various evil inclinations, lusts and desires natural to man and contrary to the Law of God. The saints, as well as others, are conscious of these sins, but with this difference: they do not permit themselves to be overcome thereby so as to obey the sins, allowing them free course; they do not yield to, but resist, such sins, and, as Paul expresses it here, incessantly purge themselves therefrom. The sins of the saints, according to him, are the very ones which they purge out. Those who obey their lusts, however, do not do this, but give rein to the flesh, and sin against the protest of their own consciences.\n" +
                        "\n" +
                        "They who resist their sinful lusts retain faith and a good conscience, a thing impossible with those who fail to resist sin and thus violate their conscience and overthrow their faith. If you persist in that which is evil regardless of the voice of conscience, you cannot say, nor believe, that you have God's favor. So then, the Christian necessarily must not yield to sinful lusts.\n" +
                        "\n" +
                        "21. The Holy Spirit is given for the very purpose of opposing sin and preventing its reign. Paul says (Ga 5:17): \"For the flesh lusteth against the Spirit, and the Spirit against the flesh . . . that ye may not do the things that ye would.\" And again (Ro 8:13): \"If by the Spirit ye put to death the deeds of the body, ye shall live.\" Also (Ro 6:12): \"Let not sin therefore reign in your mortal body, that ye should obey the lusts thereof:\"\n" +
                        "\n" +
                        "\"For our passover also hath been sacrificed, even Christ.\"\n" +

                        "[\"For even Christ our Passover is sacrificed for us.\"]\n" +
                        "\n" +
                        "22. Here Paul assigns his reason for the statement just made--\"Ye are unleavened.\" They are a new, unleavened or sweet lump, not because of any merit on their part, not because of their own holiness or worthiness, but because they have faith in Christ as the Passover sacrificed for them. This sacrifice makes them pure and holy before God. They are no more the old leaven they were when out of Christ. By this sacrifice they are reconciled with God and purified from sin.\n" +
                        "\n" +
                        "23. Likewise for us God institutes a new ordinance, a new festival. The old has given place to something wholly new. A different and better Passover sacrifice succeeds that of the Jews. The Jews had annually to partake of their offered sacrifice, but they were not thereby made holy nor pure from sin. Theirs was a sign or earnest of the true Passover to come, the Passover promised by God, in the shed blood of which we are washed from sin and wholly healed--a Passover the partaking whereof we must enjoy by faith. We have now one perpetual and eternal Easter festival, wherein faith is nourished, satisfied and gladdened; in other words, we receive remission of sins and comfort and strength through this our Passover, Christ.\n" +
                        "\n" +
                        "24. The meaning of the phrase \"sacrificed for us\" has been explained in the sermon on the Passion of Christ. Two thoughts are there presented: First, necessity of considering the greatness and terror of the wrath of God against sin in that it could be appeased and a ransom effected in no other way than through the one sacrifice of the Son of God. Only his death and the shedding of his blood could make satisfaction. And we must consider also that we by our sinfulness had incurred that wrath of God and therefore were responsible for the offering of the Son of God upon the cross and the shedding of his blood.\n" +
                        "\n" +
                        "Well may we be terrified because of our sins, for God's wrath cannot be trivial when we are told no sacrifice save alone the Son of God can brave such wrath and avail for sin. Do you imagine yourself able to endure that wrath of God, or to withstand it if you will not consider this and accept it?\n" +
                        "\n" +
                        "25. The second thought presented in the sermon mentioned is, the necessity of recognizing the inexpressible love and grace of God toward us. Only so can the terrified heart of man regain comfort. It must be made aware why God spared not his own Son but offered him a sacrifice upon the cross, delivered him to death; namely, that his wrath might be lifted from us once more. What greater love and blessing could be shown? The sacrifice of Christ is presented to us to give us sure comfort against the terrors of sin. For we may perceive and be confident that we shall not be lost because of our sins when God makes such a sacrifice the precious pledge to us of his favor and promised salvation.\n" +
                        "\n" +
                        "Therefore, though your sins are great and deserve the awful wrath of God, yet the sacrifice represented by the death of the Son of God is infinitely greater. And in this sacrifice God grants you a sure token of his grace and the forgiveness of your sins. But that forgiveness must be apprehended by the faith which holds fast the declaration, \"Christ our Passover is sacrificed for us.\" By this promise must faith be comforted and strengthened.\n" +
                        "\n" +
                        "\"Wherefore let us keep the feast, not with old leaven, neither with the leaven of malice and wickedness, but with the unleavened bread of sincerity and truth.\"\n" +
                        "\n" +
                        "26. Having, then, a Paschal Lamb and a true Easter, let us rightly value them. Let us observe the festival with the gladness it ought to inspire. Let us no longer eat the old leaven, but true wafers and paschal cakes. Where the Paschal Lamb is, there must be the unleavened bread. The former is Christ sacrificed for us. To this sacrifice we can add nothing; we can only receive and enjoy it by faith, recognizing it as a gift to us.\n" +
                        "\n" +
                        "However, possessing the Paschal Lamb, it is incumbent upon us to partake also of the sweet festal bread; in other words, while embracing the faith of the Passover, we are to maintain the true doctrine of the Gospel, illustrating it by the godly example of our own lives. We should live an eternal Easter life, as it were, to carry out Paul's analogy, a life wherein we, as justified, sanctified and purified people, continue in peace and the joy of the Holy Spirit, so long as we remain on earth.\n" +
                        "\n" +
                        "27. In this verse, as in the preceding one, Paul contrasts the leaven and the unleavened bread. He makes leaven a general term for everything which proceeds from flesh and blood and an unrenewed sinful nature, but classifies it under two heads--the leaven of malice and the leaven of wickedness. By \"malice\" we understand the various open vices and sins which represent manifest wrong to God and our neighbor. \"Wickedness\" stands for those numerous evil tricks, those nimble, subtle, venomous artifices practiced upon Christian doctrine and the Word of God with intent to corrupt and pervert them, to mislead hearts from the true meaning thereof. Paul warns (2Co 11:3): \"But I fear, lest by any means, as the serpent beguiled Eve in his craftiness, your minds should be corrupted from the simplicity and the purity that is toward Christ.\" Under \"wickedness\" comes also such evils as hypocrisy and other false, deceptive dealing practiced in the name of God by way of adorning and covering the sin, false teaching and deceptive action passed off as right, proper and Christian. Such wickedness Christ terms \"the leaven of the Pharisees and the leaven of Herod.\" Mr 8:15. This sort of leaven, particularly, we have in the world to an unspeakable extent in this last and worst of times.\n" +

                        "28. To the leaven of malice and of wickedness, Paul opposes the leaven of sincerity and truth. To be sincere is to live and act in an upright Christian way, prompted by a faithful, godly heart, a heart kindly disposed to all and meditating wrong and injury to none; and to deal as you would be dealt with. To be true is to refrain from false and crafty dealing, from deceit and roguery, and to teach and live in probity and righteousness according to the pure Word of God. Truth and sincerity must prevail and be in evidence with Christians, who have entered upon a relation and life altogether new; they should celebrate the new Easter festival by bringing faith and doctrine and life into accord with it.\n", "Dr. Maritain Luther King", "1540 A.D"));

                " salvation; the immutability of God preserves and carries it on ","OTHER Divine attributes are manifest in salvation. The wisdom of God devised the plan; the power of God executes in us the work of salvation; the immutability of God preserves and carries it on — in fact, all the attributes of God are magnified in the salvation of a sinner: but at the same time the text is most accurate, since grace is the fountain-head of salvation, and is most conspicuous throughout. Grace is to be seen in our election; for \"there is a remnant according to the election of grace, and if by grace then it is no more of works.\" Grace is manifestly revealed in our redemption, for ye know therein the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, and it is utterly inconceivable that any soul could have deserved to be redeemed with the precious blood of Christ. The mere thought is abhorrent to every holy mind. Our calling is also of grace, too, for \"He hath saved us, and called us with an holy calling, not according to our works, but according to his own purpose and grace, which was given us in Christ Jesus before the world began.\" By grace also we are justified; for over and over again the apostle insists upon this grand and fundamental truth. We are not justified before God by works in any measure or in any degree, but by faith alone; and the apostle tells us \"it is of faith, that it might be by grace.\" We see a golden thread of grace running through the whole of the Christian's history, from his election before all worlds, even to his admission to the heaven of rest. Grace, all along, \"reigns through righteousness unto eternal life,\" and \"where sin aboundeth, grace doth much more abound.\" There is no point in the history of a saved soul upon which you can put your finger and say, \"In this instance he is saved by his own deservings.\" Every single blessing which we receive from God, comes to us by the channel of free favor, revealed to us in Christ Jesus our Lord. Boasting is excluded, because deservings are excluded. Merit is an unknown word in the Christian church; it is banished once for all; and our only shoutings over foundation or topstone are, \"Grace, grace unto it!\" Perhaps the apostle is the more earnest in insisting upon this truth here, and in many other places, because this is a point against which the human heart raises the greatest objection. Every man by nature fights against salvation by grace. Though we have nothing good in ourselves, we all think we have; though we have all broken the law, and have lost all claim upon divine regard, yet we are all proud enough to fancy that we are not quite so bad as others; that there are some mitigating circumstances in our offenses, and that we can, in some measure, appeal to the justice as well as to the compassion of God. Hence the apostle puts it so strongly, \"By grace are ye saved, through faith, and that not of yourselves, it is the gift of God; not of works, lest any man should boast.\" The statement of the text means just this, that we all need saving — saving from our sins, and saving from the consequences of them; and that if we are saved it is not because of any works which we have already performed. Who among us, upon looking back at his past life, would dare to say that he deserves salvation? Neither are we saved on account of any works foreseen which are yet to be performed by us. We have made no bargain with God that we will give him so much service for so much mercy; neither has he made any covenant with us of this character; he has freely saved us, and if we serve him in the future, as we trust we shall, with all our heart and soul and strength, even then we shall have no room for glorying, because our works are wrought in us of the Lord. What have we even then which we have not received? We are saved, not because of any mitigating circumstances with regard to our transgressions, nor because we were excusable on account of our youth, or of our ignorance, or any other cause; we are not saved because there were some good points in our character, which ought not to be overlooked, or some hopeful indications of better things in the future. Ah, no; \"By grace are ye saved.\" That clear and unqualified statement sweeps away all supposition of any deserving on our part, or any thought of deserving. It is not a case of a prisoner at the bar who pleads \"not guilty,\" and who escapes because he is innocent, far from it, for we are guilty beyond all question. It is not even a case of a prisoner who pleads \"guilty,\" but at the same time mentions certain circumstances which render his offense less heinous; far from it, for our offense is heinous to the last degree, and our sin deserves the utmost wrath of God. But ours is the case of a criminal confessing his guilt and owning that he deserves the punishment, offering no extenuation and making no apology, but casting himself upon the absolute mercy of the judge, desiring him for pity's sake to look upon his misery and spare him in compassion. As condemned criminals we stand before God when we come to him for mercy. We are not in a state of probation, as some say; our probation is over: we are already lost, \"condemned already,\" and our only course is to cast ourselves upon the sovereign mercy of God in Christ Jesus; not uttering a syllable of claim, but simply saying, \"Mercy, Lord, I crave, undeserved, mercy according to thy lovingkindness, and thy grace in Christ Jesus.\" \"By grace are ye saved.\" This is true of every saint on earth and every saint in heaven, altogether true without a single sentence of qualification. No man is saved except as the result of the free favor and unbought mercy of God, not of deserving, not of debt, but entirely and altogether because the Lord \"will have mercy on whom he will have mercy,\" and he wills to bestow his favor on the unworthy sons of men. \n" +

                "\n" +
                "I. This simple truth we do not mean to work out this morning, doctrinally or controversially, out to use it for practical purposes, and the first is this — THIS GREAT DOCTRINE SHOULD INSPIRE EVERY SINNER WITH HOPE. If salvation be altogether of the free favor and grace of God, then — who among us dare despair? Who in this place shall be so wicked as to sit down in sullenness and say, \"It is impossible for me to be saved?\" For first, my brethren, if salvation be of mercy only, it is clear that our sin is by no means an impediment to our salvation. If it were of justice our transgression of the law would render our salvation utterly impossible; but if the Lord deals with us upon quite another footing, and says, \"I will forgive them freely,\" that very promise presupposes sin. If the Lord speaks of mercy, that very word takes it for granted that we are guilty, or else there would be no room for mercy at all. The very statement that we are saved by grace implies that we are fit objects for grace; and who are fit objects for grace but the guilty, the wretched, the condemned. O Souls of men, the law stops your mouths, and makes you silently own that you are guilty before God, but the gospel opens the mouth of the dumb by declaring that \"Christ died for the ungodly,\" and that \"he came into the world to save sinners.\" If mercy come into the field, sin is swallowed up in forgiveness, and unworthiness ceases to be a barrier for love. Is not this both clear and comforting? \n" +
                "\r\n" +
                "Now, observe, that this prevents the despair which might arise in any heart on account of some one especial sin. I meet with many whose terror of conscience arises from one particular crime. Had they not committed that crimson sin, they consider that they might have been pardoned, but now they are in an evil case. \"Surely,\" say they, \"that sin, like an iron bolt, has fast closed the gates of heaven against me.\" And yet it cannot be so if salvation be of grace. Whatever the sin may be, its greatness will only serve to illustrate the great grace of God. Undeserved mercy can pardon one sin as well as another, if the soul confess it. If God acted on the rule of merit with us, then no sin would be pardonable under any circumstances; but when he deals with us in a way of grace he can pass by any offense for which we seek forgiveness. The great sinner is so much the fitter object for great mercy. He who hath but little sin, can, as it were, but draw forth little mercy from God to blot it out: but he who is guilty of some great, crowning, damning sin, he it is to whom the heights and depths of divine mercy may be displayed; and if I speak to such an one this morning I would look upon him with joyful eyes. Sorrowful as he is, I am thankful to have found out such an one. Thou art a rare platform on which my Lord's love may display itself, because thou knowest thyself to be so utterly lost a sinner. Thou art but a black foil to set forth the brilliant diamond of my Master's grace. Thy foulness shall but illustrate the virtue of his precious blood, and thy crimson sin, by yielding in a moment to the precious blood, shall only show how great is his power to save. \n" +
                "\n" +
                "It is clear, too, that if the sinner's despair should arise from the long continuance, multitude, and great aggravation of his sins, there is no ground for it. For if salvation be of pure mercy only, why should not God forgive ten thousand sins as well as one? \"Oh,\" sayest thou, \"I see why he should not.\" Then thou seest more than is true; for once come to grace, you have done with bounds and limits. Know, moreover, that \"his thoughts are not your thoughts. And as the heavens are higher than the earth so are his thoughts higher than your thoughts and his ways than your ways.\" To blot out ten thousand sins is with him no effort of grace, for \"he is plenteous in mercy.\" He has been forgiving the sons of men ever since the first sinner crossed the threshold of Paradise, and he delights to do it; so that, guilty ones, I see in the multitude of your sins only so much the more room for the Lord to exercise his own delightful attribute of mercy. If he delights to blot out one sin, then he delights ten thousand times more to blot out ten thousand sins. If thou wilt look at it in that light, though thy transgressions may be as many as the hairs on thy head or as the sands on the sea shore, innumerable, thou needest not for a moment think thou art cast away from hope. The Lord's mercy is a sea which cannot be filled, though mountains of sin be cast into its midst; it is like Noah's flood, which covers all and drowns even the mountain-tops of heaven-defying sins. I wish to speak right home to the hearts of those who are in trouble and seeking mercy, and to them I say, — do you not see that if salvation be of grace alone, then the depravity of thy nature does not shut thee up in despair? What though thy nature be inclined to sin, and especially inclined to some sins; what if thou be naturally angry and passionate, or if thou be proud and covetous; what if thou be in thy natural disposition sceptical or lustful, yet from the grace of God hope flows even for thee. If the Lord were to deal with thee according to thy constitution and nature, then, indeed, it were a hopeless case with thee: but if he blesses thee, not because thou art good, but because thou needest to be blest; if he looks upon thee in mercy, not because thou art beautiful, but because thou art sick unto death, and defiled, and needest to be healed and cleansed; if it be thy misery and not thy merit which he considers, then thou art yet in the land of hope. However fallen thou mayest be, thou mayest yet be raised up. Why should not the Lord take the most depraved, and abandoned, and obstinate among us, and renew his nature and make of him a miracle of grace? Would it not magnify his mercy if he should make of such an one the opposite of what he now is, tender in heart, holy in spirit, devout in character, ardent in love, and fervent in prayer? He can do it. Glory be to his name, he can do it; and now that he deals with us in grace let us hope he will do it in the case of many. \n" +
                "\n" +
                "Remember, too, that any spiritual unfitness which may exist in a man should not shut him out from a hope, since God deals with us in mercy. I hear you say, \"I believe God can save me, but I am so impenitent.\" Yes, and I say it again, if thou wert to stand on terms of debt with God, thy hard heart would shut thee out of hope. How could he bless such a wretch as thou art, whose heart is a heart of stone? But if he deal with thee entirely upon another ground, namely, his mercy, why I think I hear him say, \"Poor hard-hearted sinner, I will pity thee, and take away thy heart of stone, and give thee a heart of flesh.\" Dost thou say, \"I cannot repent?\" I know the criminality of that sad fact. It is a great sin not to be able to repent; but then the Lord will not look upon thee from the point of what thou oughtest to be, but he will consider what he can make thee, and he will give thee repentance. Has not his Son gone up to heaven, \"exalted on high, to give repentance and remission of sins?\" Do I hear thee confess that thou canst not believe? Now, the absence of faith from thee is a great evil, yea a horrible evil; but then the Lord is dealing with thee on terms of grace, and does not say, \"I will not smite thee because thou dost not believe,\" but he saith, \"I will give thee faith,\" for faith is \"not of yourselves, it is the gift of God.\" He works our faith in us, and has pity upon us, and takes away the unbelieving heart, and gives the tender heart, the believing heart, in the presence of the cross of Christ. Oh, though I were black as the devil with past sin, and vile as the devil with innate depravity, yet, if the Lord's mercy looked upon me could he not forgive the past and chance my nature, and make me, as bright a seraph as Gabriel before his throne? \"Is anything too hard for the Lord?\" O sinner, what a door of hope there ought to be open to thee in this truth, that salvation is altogether of grace. \n" +
                "\n" +
                "For now, to sum up all in a word, there is no supposable circumstance or incident, or anything, connected with any man, that can shut him out of hope if he seek forgiveness through the Savior's blood. Whoever thou mayest be, and whatever thou mayest have done, grace can come and save thee. I say again, if thy character be the question at issue, thou art a lost man; if thy power to amend thy character be the hinge of the business, thou art a lost man; but if the grace that pardons and the power that amends both come from God, why shouldest thou be a lost man? Why should the harlot perish? Why should the thief perish? Why should the adulterer perish? Why should the murderer perish? \"Let the wicked forsake his way, and the unrighteous man his thoughts, and let him turn unto the Lord, and he will have mercy upon him, and to our God for he will abundantly pardon.\" Ye have heaped up your sins, but God will heap up his mercies; ye have highly aggravated your transgressions; ye have sinned against light and knowledge; ye have done evil with both hands greedily; but, thus saith the Lord, \"I have blotted out, as a thick cloud, thy transgressions, and, as a cloud, thy sins: return unto me; for I have redeemed thee.\" \"Come now, and let us reason together, saith the Lord: though your sins be as scarlet, they shall be white as snow; though they be red like crimson, they shall be as wool.\" Thus much upon the first statement, that this doctrine ought to give hope to the sinner. \n" +
                "\n" +
                "II. Secondly, THIS DOCTRINE AFFORDS DIRECTION TO THE SINNER, as to how to act before his God in seeking mercy. Clearly, O soul, if salvation be of grace alone, it would be a very wrong course of action to plead that thou art not guilty, or to extenuate thy faults before God: that were to go upon the wrong tack altogether. If salvation be by thy merit, or by an absence of demerit, then thou wouldst be right enough to set up a good character as a plea, though I believe that in the trial thou wouldest mightily break down, for thou art as full of sin as an egg is of meat, and thy sin is as damnable as hell itself, and therefore it were vain for thee to plead innocence; but if thou couldest plead it, it is the wrong plea. If salvation be of grace, then go to the Lord and confess thy sin and transgression, and ask for grace. Do not for a moment attempt to show that thou hast no need of grace, for that were folly indeed. What more foolish than for a beggar to plead that he is not in want? Do not shut the door of grace in thine own face. To say, \"I am not guilty,\" is to say \"I do not want mercy;\" to say \"I have not transgressed,\" is to say, \"I do not need to be forgiven,\" and how better couldest thou commit spiritual suicide than by such pleading? \n" +
                "\n" +
                "Neither, O sinner, hope to propitiate the Lord with gifts and sacrifices. If salvation be of grace, how durst thou think to buy it? If he saith he gives it freely, bring not with thee any bribe in thy hand: for in so doing thou wilt insult and anger him. Indeed, what couldest thou bring to him when Lebanon is not sufficient to burn, nor the beasts thereof for a burnt sacrifice? If thou couldest give him rivers of oil that should deluge a continent, or seas of sacrificial blood broad as the Pacific, yet couldest thou not for a moment render thyself acceptable with him. Try it not therefore. Venture on no ceremonies. Rest not in rituals. If salvation be of grace, accept it as a free gift, and bless the giver. Do not think to dress thyself in garments of outward religiousness, or to borrow virtue from a fellowman who claims to be a priest; but since salvation is of free mercy, go and cast thyself on that free mercy. That is to act according to the dictates of prudence. Thy true course is this. Since God is willing to show his mercy, go and confess that thou needest that mercy. Aggravate thy sin in the confession, if thou canst. Instead of trying to make it appear white, try to see its unutterable blackness. Say that thou art without excuse, justly condemned, for thy transgressions. I warrant thee thou shalt never go beyond the truth in stating thy sin, for that were quite impossible. A man lying on the field of battle wounded, when the surgeon comes round, or the soldiers with the ambulance, does not say, \"Oh, mine is a little wound,\" for he knows that then they would let him lie; but he cries out, \"I have been bleeding here for hours, and am nearly dead with a terrible wound,\" for he thinks that then he will gain speedier relief; and when he gets into the hospital he does not say to the nurse, \"Mine is a small affair; I shall soon get over it;\" but he tells the truth to the surgeon in the hope that he may set the bone at once, and that double care may be taken. Ah, sinner, do thou so with God. The right way to plead is to plead thy misery, thine impotence, thy danger, thy sin. Lay bare thy wounds before the Lord, and as Hezekiah spread Sennacherib's letter before the Lord, spread thy sins before him with many a tear and many a cry, and say, \"Lord, save me from all these; save me from these black and foul things, for thy infinite mercy's sake.\" Confess thy sin; wisdom dictates that thou shouldest do so, since salvation is of grace. And then yield thyself up to God; capitulate at discretion; make no terms with him, but say, \"Here I stand before thee, O my Maker; I have offended thee; I yield to thee, because thou hast said thou wilt deal with me on terms of grace; behold I cast myself at thy feet; the weapons of my rebellion I cast from my hands for ever; I desire that thou wouldest take me and make me what thou wouldest have me to be; and seeing thou art a God of grace, I beseech thee to have pity upon me. Thou hast appointed a way of salvation by Jesus Christ, Oh, save me in that way, I entreat thee.\" Now, mark, I want to dwell upon this next point, — because salvation is of grace it directs the guilty as to how to plead before God. When we are praying and pleading we sometimes feel we want a help to guide us in the pleading. Let this guide you. Take care that all your pleas with God are consistent with the fact that he saves by his grace. Never bring a legal plea, or a plea that is based upon self, for it will be an offense to God; whereas, if thine argument be based on grace, it will have a sweet savor to him. Let me teach thee, seeking sinner, for a moment how to pray. Let it be in this way. Plead with God thy miserable and undone condition; tell him thou art utterly lost if he do not save thee. Tell him thou art already lost, so that thou canst not help thyself hand or foot in this matter, if he do not come to thy rescue with the fullness of his power and love. Tell him that thou art afraid to die and to come before his righteous bar, for unless he save thee hell will be thy portion. Plead with him and ask him whether it will delight him that thou shouldest make thy bed in hell. Say to him, \"Shall the dead praise thee? Shall the condemned set forth the praise?\" Show him the imminence of thy danger. He knows it, but let him see that thou knowest it, and this will be good pleading with his mercy. \"Save me, O Lord, for if ever soul needed saving, if ever soul were in the jaws of destruction, I am that soul, therefore have pity upon me.\" Thus pour out your heart before him. Then humbly urge the suitableness of his mercy to you. \"Lord, thou art merciful, thy mercy will find ample scope in me. Does thy grace seek out sin to purge it away? It is here, Lord I teem with it; my heart swarms with evils. If thou art pitiful, here is a heart which bleeds and is ready to perish. Oh, if thou be indeed a physicist, here is a sick soul that wants thee; if thou art ready to forgive, here are sins that need forgiving. Come to me, Lord, for thy mercy will find a grievousness of misery in me. Besides, is not thy mercy free. It is true I do not deserve it, but thou dost not give it to men because of their deserving, else were it no grace and mercy at all. Let thy free mercy light on me. Why shouldest thou pass me by? If I be the vilest of the sons of men thou wilt be the more gracious if thou dost look upon me. What though I have forgotten thee these many years and have even despised thy love, will it not be the greater mercy on thy part to turn and give thy free grace to me, even to me?\" Then argue with him the plenteousness of his grace. Say to him, \"Lord, thy mercy is very great, I know it is. 'According to the multitude of thy tender mercies, blot out my transgressions.' If thou wert a little God and thou hadst but little mercy, I should have but little hope in thee, but oh, thou art so great and glorious, thou canst cast my transgressions behind thy back. By the greatness of thy compassion, then, look thou on me.\" It is well also to return to the first plea and repeat it, saying, \"Lord, because thou hast this greet mercy and I need it, look on my impotence this day. I am so weak, I cannot come to thee unless thou come to me. Thou biddest me repent, but see how hard my heart is; thou commandest me to believe in Jesus, but my unbelief is very strong; thou tellest me to look to thy dear Son upon the cross, but I cannot see him for my tears, which blind these weary eyes. Master, come to the rescue, come and help thy servant, for thou art strong, though I be weak. Thou canst break my heart though I cannot break it, and thou canst open my poor bleared eyes, though I cannot as yet see as I would see the Savior Jesus Christ. Oh! by thy power and mercy save a weak, dead sinner.\" And then, if you feel as if you wanted some other plea, begin to plead his promises. Say: \n" +
                "\n" +
                "\"Thou hast promised to forgive All who on thy Son believe; Lord, I know thou canst not lie; Give me Christ or else I die.\" \n" +
                "\n" +
                "\"Thou hast said that if the wicked forsake his way and turn unto thee he shall live. Lord, I turn to thee. Receive me. Thou hast said that all manner of sin and of blasphemy shall be forgiven unto men. Thou hast declared that the blood of Jesus Christ thy Son cleanseth from all sin. Go not back from thy word, O God. Since thou art dealing with men on terms of grace, keep thy promise and let thy rich, free mercy come to me.\" I know what all this means by experience. I have gone over all these pleas by the week together, and pleaded with God that he would have mercy upon me. \"This poor man cried, and the Lord heard him, and delivered him from all his fears.\" Therefore, bear I testimony unto you, O seeking souls, that this is the way to move his heart. Go upon the plan of grace, and plead his love. Not your deservings, but your undeservings; not your profession of what you hope to do, but your acknowledgment of your misery, will have power with him. \n" +
                "\n" +
                "I have found it sweet work sometimes to plead with God his mercy in the gifts of Christ. Let me help thee, sinner, to do it, and may the Spirit help thee. Say thou unto God thus, \"Lord, thou hast given thine only begotten Son to die; surely he need not have died for the righteous; he died for the guilty; I am such an one; Lord, wilt thou give thy Son for sinners, and then cast sinners away? Didst thou nail him to the cross only for a mockery, that we might come to that cross, and not find pity? O thou God of mercy, in the gift of thy Son thou hast done so much that thou canst not draw back; thou must save sinners, now that thou hast given Jesus to die for them.\" Then plead with Jesus the compassion of his heart. Tell him that he said he would not break the bruised reed nor quench the smoking flax. Pluck him by the sleeve, and say, \"Thou hast said 'Him that cometh unto me, I will in no wise cast out.'\" Tell him that it was written of him, \"This man receiveth sinners and eateth with them.\" Tell him that thou hast heard that \"this is a faithful saying, and worthy of all acceptation, that Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners;\" and say to him, \"Hast thou lost thy compassion, Savior? Wilt thou not dart a glance of love on me, even me? Thou didst heal lepers, heal my leprosy. Thou didst permit the woman, whom thou didst call a dog, to come and receive blessings at thy hands; and although I \n" +
                "\n" +
                "be a dog, yet give the crumbs of thy mercy to me, even me.\" This is the style of plea that will win the day. \n" +
                "\n" +
                "And then I would advise thee, if thou failest still in prayer, to go to God thus, and say to him, \"Lord, thou hast sworn with an oath — 'As I live, saith the Lord, I have no pleasure in the death of him that dieth, but had rather that he would turn to me and live.' I know that thou meanest this, my God; wilt thou take pleasure then in my death, and spurn me now that I turn to thee?\" Tell him that he has saved other sinners like thyself. Remind him of thy wife, or child, or friend; tell him of Saul of Tarsus; tell him of the woman that was a sinner; tell him of Rahab; and say unto him, \"Lord, dost thou not delight to save great, big, black sinners? and I am just such an one. Thou hast not changed. By all that thou hast done for others, I pray thee do the like for me.\" And then say to him again, \"I thank thee, O God, that thou hast permitted me even to pray to thee; I bless thy grace that thou hast moved me to come to thee; and as thou hast given me grace to feel my sin in a measure, wilt thou leave me to perish after all? Oh, by the grace I have received in being spared so long, in being permitted to hear thy gospel, I beseech thee to give me more grace.\" Then throw yourself down before him, and if you perish, perish there. Go to the cross with such pleas as these, and resolve that if it can be that a sinner may die at the cross' foot, you will die there, but nowhere else. As the Lord my God liveth, before whom I stand, there shall never a soul perish that can cast itself upon the sovereign grace of God through Jesus Christ his Son. \n" +
                "\n" +
                "III. Now, to turn away from that to a third point. A FULL CONVICTION OF THIS TRUTH WILL RECONCILE OUR HEARTS TO ALL DIVINE ORDINANCES WITH REGARD TO SALVATION. I feel in my own heart, and I think every believer here does, that if salvation be of grace, God must do as he wills with his own. None of us can say to him, \"What doest thou?\" If there were anything of debt, or justice, or obligation, in the matter, then we might begin to question God; but as there is none, and the thing is quite out of court as to law, and far away from rights and claims, as it is all God's free favor, we will henceforth stop our mouths and never question him. As to the persons whom he chooses to save, let him save whom he wills. His name shall be had in honor for ever, let his choice be what it may. As to the instrument by whom he saves, let him save by the coarsest speaker, or by the most eloquent; let him do what seemeth him good. If he will save by the Bible, without ministers, we will be glad to hold our tongues; and if he will save souls by one of our brethren, and not by us, we will grieve to think that we are so little fitted for his service; but still, if after doing all we can, he uses another more than us, we will say, \"Blessed be his name.\" We will not envy our brethren. The Lord shall distribute his grace by what hands he pleases. Send, Lord, by whomsoever thou wilt send. \n" +

                "And here I come to the sinner again: with the two great gospel commands we will raise no dispute. Hath he said, \"He that believeth and is baptised shall be saved?\" We will never raise a question against either the believing or the baptism. If the Lord chooses to say, \"I will save those who trust in Christ,\" it is both so natural a thing that he should claim our faith, and so gracious a thing that he should give us the faith he claims of us that we cannot question it. And even if it were not so, he has a right to make what rules he pleases. If God permits entrance only by one door, let us enter by it and raise no contention. The Lord bids thee trust in Jesus; say not in thy heart, \"I would rather do or feel some wonderful matter.\" If he had bidden thee do some great thing wouldst thou not have done it? How much rather now that he saith to thee, simply trust in Jesus and be saved. I know if I were authorized to preach this morning that every man who would sail round the world should be saved, you would begin saving your money to make the great excursion; but when the gospel comes to you there in those very pews and aisles, and bids you now turn your eyes to the crucified Savior and only look to him, I know if you have not learned the truth, that salvation is of grace, you will kick at that divine command; but if you know it is of grace, and only grace, you will say, \"Sweet is the command of God; Lord, enable me now to trust myself with thy dear Son.\" And, then, you will not quarrel with the ordinance of baptism either. I know it is very natural that you should say, \"What is there in it?\" I also would say, what is there in it? What can there be in a mere washing in water? If you thought there were any salvation by it meritoriously, you would have missed the track altogether; but the Lord hath put it, that \"he that believeth and is baptized, shall be saved,\" and therefore you obey. I do not attempt to justify my Lord for so commanding, for he needs no defense from me, but if he so chooses to put it, the true heart will yield a prompt obedience to his will. If it were of merit, I could see no merit in baptism or in the believing, for surely it cannot be meritorious to believe what is true, or to have one's body washed with pure water. But salvation is of grace; and if the Lord chooses to put it so, let him put it as he wills. I am such a sinner, I will take his mercy, let him present it in what way he pleases. \n" +
                "\n" +
                "As to the manner in which the Lord may be pleased to reveal himself to any one of us, I am sure that if we know that salvation is of grace, we shall never quarrel about that any more. To some of us, the Lord revealed himself on a sudden. We know when we were converted to a day. I know the place to a yard. But many others do not. The day breaks on them gradually; first twilight, then a brighter light, and afterwards comes the noon. Do not let us quarrel about that. So long as I get a Savior, I do not mind how I get him; so long as he blots out my sins, I will not cavil about the way in which he manifests his love to me. If it be of grace, that silences everything; Jew and Gentile shut their mouths without a murmuring word, and all together sit down at the foot of the cross, no more to question, but reverently to adore. \n" +
                "\n" +
                "IV. I pass over this point rapidly, for time flies. I fain would clip his wings. But I must needs introduce to you the next fact, — that the doctrine that salvation is of grace furnishes to those who receive it A MOST POWERFUL MOTIVE FOR FUTURE HOLINESS. \n" +
                "\n" +
                "A man who feels that he is saved by grace says, \"Did God of his free favor blot out my sins? Then, oh, how I love him. Was it nothing but his love that saved an undeserving wretch? Then my soul is knit to him for ever.\" Great sin becomes in such a case no barrier to great holiness, but rather a motive for it; for he who has had much forgiven loves much, and loving much he begins at once to be in earnest in the service of him whom he loves. I put it to thee, sinner, if the Lord this morning were to appear to thee and say, \"All thy sins have been blotted out,\" wouldst thou not love him? Ay, methinks a dog would love such a Master as that. Wouldst thou not love him? Ay, I know thou wouldst. I know you proud, self-righteous people, would not; but you real sinners, if pardon were to come to you, would you not love God with all your hearts? Assuredly you would, and then your soul would begin to burn with a desire to honor him. You would want to tell the next person you met — \"The Lord has had mercy upon me; wonder of wonders, he has had mercy upon me.\" And then you would desire to put away everything that would displease him. Away ye sins, away ye sins: how can I defile myself with you again? And then you would desire to practice all his wild, and say, \"For the love I bear his name no duty shall be too difficult, no command too severe.\" There are none that love God like those who are saved by grace. The man who thinks to save himself by works does not love God at all; he loves himself; he is a servant working for wages, and that is the kind of servant who would turn to another master tomorrow if he could get better paid, and if the wages do not suit him he will strike. The old-fashioned servants were the best servants in the world, for they loved their masters, and if paid no wages at all would have stuck to the family for love's sake. Such are the servants of God who are saved by his grace. \"Why,\" say they, \"he has already pardoned me and saved me, and therefore my ear is bored and fastened to the door of his house to be his servant for ever; and my glory is, 'I am thy servant, I am thy servant, and the son of thy handmaid, thou hast loosed my bonds.'\" Such a man feels that he must perfect holiness in the fear of the Lord. He will not stop short with a measure of grace; he wants immeasurable grace. He will not say, \"There are some sins in me which I cannot overcome;\" but by God's grace he will seek to drive out all the Amalekites. He will not say, \"Up to this point I am commanded to go, but beyond that I have a licence to say, 'That is my besetting sin; I cannot get rid of it.'\" No, but loving God with all his heart he will hate sin with all his heart, and war with sin with all his might, and will never put sword in scabbard till he is perfected in the image of Christ. The Lord fires us with such ardent love as this, and I know no way by which to get it except by coming to him on terms of grace, confessing sin, receiving mercy, feeling love kindle in the heart in consequence, and thus the whole soul becomes consecrated to the Lord. \n" +

Thou shalt perish, for thou dost insult thy God by thinking thyself wiser than his word, and by fancying that thy righteousness is purer than the righteousness of Christ. Thou dost imagine thou canst force thy way to heaven by a road that is most effectually blocked up, thou dost despise the path which the Lord has opened. Beware of self-righteousness. The black devil of licentiousness destroys his hundreds, but the white devil of self- righteousness destroys his thousands. But dost thou accept this text as a foundation stone?

Come and be filled out of the fullness which is treasured up in Christ Jesus. Believe in Jesus now, for one act of faith sets thee free from all sin. Do not tarry for a moment, nor raise questions with thy God. Believe him capable of infinite mercy, and through Jesus Christ rest thou in him. If thou be the worst soul in the world to thine own apprehension, and the one odd man that would be left out of every catalogue of grace, now write not such things against thyself; or even if thou do, come and cast thyself upon thy God. He cannot reject thee or if he should, thou wouldst be the first that ever trusted in him and was confounded. Come and try. Oh! that his Spirit may bring thee to Jesus at this very moment, and that in heaven there may be joy in the presence of the angels of God because a soul has confided in the grace of God and found immediate pardon, instantaneous salvation, through the precious blood of Christ.

                "\n" +
                "IF we would influence thoughtful persons it must be by solid arguments. Shallow minds may be wrought upon by mere warmth of emotion and force of excitement, but the more valuable part of the community must be dealt with in quite another manner. When the apostle Paul was desirous to influence his son in the faith, Timothy, who was a diligent and earnest student and a man of gifts as well as of grace, he did not attempt to affect him by mere appeals to his feelings, but felt that the most effectual way to act upon him was to remind him of solid doctrinal truth which he knew him to have believed. This is a lesson for the ministry at large. Certain earnest preachers are incessantly exciting the people, and but seldom if ever instructing them; they carry much fire and very little light. God forbid that we should say a word against appealing to the feelings; this is most needful in its place, but then there is a due proportion to be observed in it. A religion, which is based upon, sustained, and maintained simply by excitement, will necessarily be very flimsy and unsubstantial, and will yield very speedily to the crush of opposition or to the crumbling hand of time. The preacher may touch the feelings by rousing appeals, as the harper touches the harp strings; he will be very foolish if he should neglect so ready and admirable an instrument; but still as he is dealing with reasonable creatures, he must not forget to enlighten the intellect and instruct the understanding. And how can he appeal to the understanding better than by presenting to it the truth which the Holy Ghost teacheth? Scriptural doctrine must furnish us with powerful motives to urge upon the minds of Christians. It seems to me that if we could by some unreasoning impulse move you to a certain course of action it might be well in its way, but it would be unsafe and untrustworthy, for you would be equally open to be moved in an opposite direction by other persons more skillful in such operations; but if God enables us by his Spirit to influence your minds by solid truth and substantial argument, you will then move with a constancy of power which nothing can turn aside. The feather flies in the wind, but it has no inherent power to move, and consequently when the gale is over it falls to the ground-such is the religion of excitement; but the eagle has life within itself, and its wings bear it aloft and onward whether the breeze favors it or no-such is religion, when sustained by a conviction of the truth. The well-taught man in Christ Jesus stands firm where the uninstructed infant would fall or be carried away. \"Be not carried about with every wind of doctrine,\" says the apostle, and those are least likely to be so carried who are well established in the truth as it is in Jesus. \n" +
                "\n" +
                "It is somewhat remarkable-at least it may seem so to persons who are not accustomed to think upon the subject-that the apostle, in order to excite Timothy to boldness, to keep him constant in the faith, reminds him of the great doctrine that the grace of God reigns in the salvation of men. He gives in this verse-this parenthetical verse as some call it, but which seems to me to be fully in the current of the passage- he gives in this verse a brief summary of the gospel, showing the great prominence which it gives to the grace of God, with the design of maintaining Timothy in the boldness of his testimony for Christ. I do not doubt but that a far greater power for usefulness lies concealed within the doctrines of grace than some men have ever dreamed of. It has been usual to look upon doctrinal truth as being nothing more than unpractical theory, and many have spoken of the precepts of God's Word as being more practical and more useful; the day may yet come when in clearer light we shall perceive that sound doctrine is the very root and vital energy of practical holiness, and that to teach the people the truth which God has revealed is the readiest and surest way of leading them to obedience and persevering holiness. \n" +

                "\n" +
                "Friends will remember that it is not our object to preach the doctrine which is most popular or most palatable, nor do we desire to set forth the views of any one person in the assembly; our one aim is to give what we judge to be the meaning of the text. We shall probably deliver doctrine which many of you will not like, and if you should not like it we shall not be at all surprised, or even if you should be vexed and angry we shall not be at all alarmed, because we never understood that we were commissioned to preach what would please our hearers, nor were expected by sensible, not to say gracious men, to shape our views to suit the notions of our audience. We count ourselves amenable to God and to the text; and if we give the meaning of the text, we believe we shall give the mind of God, and we shall be likely to have his favor, which will be sufficient for us, contradict us who may. However, let every candid mind be willing to receive the truth, if it be clearly in the inspired Word. \n" +
                "\n" +
                "1. The apostle in stating his doctrine in the following words, \"Who hath saved us, and called us with an holy calling, not according to our works, but according to his own purpose and grace, which was given us in Christ Jesus before the world began,\" declares God to be the author of salvation,- \"Who hath saved us and called us.\" The whole tenor of the verse is towards a strong affirmation of Jonah's doctrine, \"that salvation is of the Lord.\" It would require very great twisting, involving more than ingenuity, it would need dishonesty, to make out salvation by man out of this text; but to find salvation altogether of God in it is to perceive the truth which lies upon the very surface. No need for profound enquiry, the wayfaring man though a fool shall not err therein; for the text says as plainly as words can say, \"God hath saved us, and called us with an holy calling.\" The apostle, then, in order to bring forth the truth that salvation is of grace declares that it is of God, that it springs directly and entirely from him and from him only. Is not this according to the teaching of the Holy Spirit in other places, where he affirms over and over again that the alpha and omega of our salvation must be found not in ourselves but in our God? Our apostle in saying that God hath saved us refers to all the persons of the Divine Unity. The Father hath saved us. \"God hath given to us eternal life.\" 1Jo 5:2. \"The Father himself loveth you.\" It was he whose gracious mind first conceived the thought of redeeming his chosen from the ruin of the fall; it was his mind which first planned the way of salvation by substitution; it was from his generous heart that the thought first sprang that Christ should suffer as the covenant head of his people, as saith the apostle, \"Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who hath blessed us with all spiritual blessings in heavenly places in Christ. According as he hath chosen us in him before the foundation of the world, that we should be holy and without blame before him in love: having predestinated us unto the adoption of children by Jesus Christ to himself, according to the good pleasure of his will, to the praise of the glory of his grace, wherein he hath made us accepted in the Beloved.\" Eph 1:3-6. From the bowels of divine compassion came the gift of the only begotten Son: \"For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.\" The Father selected the persons who should receive an interest in the redemption of his Son, for these are described as \"called according to his purpose.\" Ro 8:28. The plan of salvation in all its details sprang from the Father's wisdom and grace. The apostle did not, however, overlook the work of the Son. It is most certainly through the Son of God that we are saved, for is not his name Jesus, the Savior? Incarnate in the flesh, his holy life is the righteousness in which saints are arrayed; while his ignominious and painful death has filled the sacred hath of blood in which the sinner must be washed that he may be made clean. It is through the redemption, which is in Christ Jesus that the people of God become accepted in the Beloved. With one consent before the eternal throne they sing, \"Unto him that loved us and washed us from our sins in his blood, unto him be glory;\" and they chant that hymn because he deserves the glory which they ascribe to him. It is the Son of God who is the Savior of men, and men are not the saviours of themselves. \n" +
                "\n" +
                "Nor did the apostle, I am persuaded, forget that Third Person in the blessed Unity-the Holy Spirit. Who but the Holy Spirit first gives us power to understand the gospel? for \"the carnal mind understandeth not the things that be of God.\" Doth not the Holy Spirit influence our will, turning us from the obstinacy of our former rebellion to the obedience of the truth? Doth not the Holy Ghost renew us, creating us in Christ Jesus unto good works? Is it not by the Holy Spirit's breath that we live in the spiritual life? Is he not to us instructor, comforter, quickener, is he not everything, in fact, through his active operations upon our mind? The Father, then, in planning, the Son in redeeming, the Spirit in applying the redemption must be spoken of as the one God \"who hath saved us.\" Brethren, to say that we save ourselves is to utter a manifest absurdity. We are called in Scripture \"a temple\" -a holy temple in the Lord. But shall any one assert that the stones of the edifice were their own architect? Shall it be said that the stones of the building in which we are now assembled cut themselves into their present shape, and then spontaneously came together, and piled this spacious edifice? Should any one assert such a foolish thing, we should be disposed to doubt his sanity; much more may we suspect the spiritual sanity of any man who should venture to affirm that the great temple of the church of God designed and erected itself. No: we believe that God the Father was the architect, sketched the plan, supplies the materials, and will complete the work. Shall it also be said that those who are redeemed redeemed themselves? that slaves of Satan break their own fetters? Then why was a Redeemer needed at all? How should there be any need for Jesus to descend into the world to redeem those who could redeem themselves? Do you believe that the sheep of God, whom he has taken from between the jaws of the lion, could have rescued themselves? It were a strange thing if such were the case. Our Lord Jesus came not to do a work of supererogation, but if he came to save persons who might have saved themselves, he certainly came without a necessity for so doing. We cannot believe that Christ came, to do what the sinners might have done themselves. No. \"He hath trodden the wine press alone, and of the people there was none with him,\" and the redemption of his people shall give glory unto himself only. Shall it be asserted that those who were once dead have spiritually quickened themselves? Can the dead make themselves alive? Who shall assert that Lazarus, rotting in the grave, came forth to life of himself? If it be so said and so believed, then, nay, not even then, will we believe that the dead in sin have ever quickened themselves. Those who are saved by God the Holy Spirit are created anew according to Scripture; but who ever dreamed of creation creating itself? God spake the world out of nothing, but nothing did not aid in the creation of the universe Divine energy can do everything, but what can nothing do? Now if we have a new creation, there must have been a creator, and it is clear that not being then spiritually created, we could not have assisted in our own new creation, unless, indeed, death can assist life, and non-existence aid in creation. The carnal mind does not assist the Spirit of God in new creating a man, but altogether regeneration is the work of God the Holy Ghost, and the work of renewal is from his unassisted power. Father, Son, and Spirit we then adore, and putting these thoughts together, we would humbly prostrate ourselves at the foot of the throne of the august Majesty, and acknowledge that if saved he alone hath saved us, and unto him be the glory. \n" +
                "\n" +
                "2. We next remark that grace is in this verse rendered conspicuous when we see that God pursues a singular method, \"Who hath saved us and called us.\" The peculiarity of the manner lies in three things first, in the completeness of it. The apostle uses the perfect tense and says, \"who hath saved us.\" Believers in Christ Jesus are saved. They are not looked upon as persons who are in a hopeful state and may ultimately be saved, but they are already saved. This is not according to the common talk of professors now-a-days, for many of them speak of being saved when they come to die; but it is according to the usage of Scripture to speak of us who are saved. Be it known this morning that every man and woman here is either saved at this present moment or lost, and that salvation is not a blessing to be enjoyed upon the dying bed and to be sung of in a future state above, but a matter to be obtained, received, promised and enjoyed now. God hath saved his saints, mark, not partly saved them, but perfectly saved them. The Christian is perfectly saved in God's purpose; God has ordained him unto salvation, and that purpose is complete. He is saved also as to the price which has been paid for him; for this is done not in part but in whole. The substitutionary work which Christ has offered is not a certain proportion of the work to be done, but \"it is finished\" was the cry of the Savior ere he died. The believer is also perfectly saved in his covenant head, for as we were utterly lost as soon as ever Adam fell, before we had committed any actual sin, so every man in Christ was saved in the second Adam when he finished his work. The Savior completed his work, and in the sense in which Paul uses that expression, \"He hath saved us.\" This completeness is one peculiarity-we must mark another. I want you to notice the order as well as the completeness; \"who hath saved us and called us. What! saved us before he called us? Yes, so the text says. But is a man saved before he is called by grace? Not in his own experience, not as far as the work of the Holy Spirit goes, but he is saved in God's purpose, in Christ's redemption, and in his relationship to his covenant Head; and he is saved, moreover, in this respect, that the work of his salvation is done, and he has only to receive it as a finished work. In the olden times of imprisonment for debt, it would have been quite correct for you to step into the cell of a debtor and say to him, I have freed you, if you had paid his debts and obtained an order for his discharge. Well, but he is still in prison. Yes; but you really liberated him as soon as you paid his debts. It is true he was still in prison, but he was not legally there, and no sooner did he know that the debt was paid, and that receipt was pleaded before proper authorities, than the man obtained his liberty. So the Lord Jesus Christ paid the debts of his people before they knew anything about it. Did he not pay them on the cross more than eighteen hundred years ago to the utmost penny? and is not this the reason why, as soon as he meets with us in a way of grace, he cries, \"I have saved thee; lay hold on eternal life.\" We are, then, virtually, though not actually, saved before we are called. \"He hath saved us and called us.\" There is yet a third peculiarity, and that is in connection with the calling. God has called us with an holy calling. Those whom the Savior saved upon the tree are in due time effectually called by the power of God the Holy Spirit unto holiness; they leave their sins, they endeavor to be like Christ, they choose holiness, not out of any compulsion, but from the stress of a new nature, which leads them to rejoice in holiness, just as naturally as aforetime they delighted in sin. Whereas their old nature loved everything that was evil, their new nature cannot sin because it is born of God, and it loveth everything that is good. Does not the apostle mention this result of our calling in order to meet those who say that God calls his people because he foresees their holiness? Not so; he calls them to that holiness; that holiness is not a cause but an effect; it is not the motive of his purpose, but the result of his purpose. He neither chose them nor called them because they were holy, but he called them that they might be holy, and holiness is the beauty produced by his workmanship in them. The excellences which we see in a believer are as much the work of God as the atonement itself. This second point brings out very sweetly the fullness of the grace of God. First: salvation must be of grace, because the Lord is the author of it; and what motive but grace could move him to save the guilty? In the next place, salvation must be of grace, because the Lord works in such a manner that our righteousness is for ever excluded. Salvation is completed by God, and therefore not of man, neither by man; salvation is wrought by God in an order which puts our holiness as a consequence and not as a cause, and therefore merit is for ever disowned. \n" +
                "\n" +
                "3. When a speaker desires to strengthen his point and to make himself clear, he generally puts in a negative as to the other side. So the apostle adds a negative:- \"Not according to our works.\" The world's great preaching is, \"Do as well as you can, live a moral life, and God will save you.\" The gospel preaching is this:- \"Thou art a lost sinner, and thou canst deserve nothing of God but his displeasure; if thou art to be saved, it must be by an act of sovereign grace. God must freely extend the silver scepter of his love to thee, for thou art a guilty wretch who deserves to be sent to the lowest hell. Thy best works are so full of sin that they can in no degree save thee; to the free mercy of God thou must owe all things.\" \"Oh,\" saith one, \"are good works of no use?\" God's works are of use when a man is saved, they are the evidences of his being saved; but good works do not save a man, good works do not influence the mind of God to save a man, for if so, salvation would be a matter of debt and not of grace. The Lord has declared over and over in his Word, \"Not of works, lest any man should boast.\" \"By the works of the law there shall no flesh living be justified.\" The apostle in the epistle to the Galatians is very strong indeed upon this point; indeed he thunders it out again, and again, and again. He denies that salvation is even so much as in part due to our works, for if it be by work then he declares it is not of grace, otherwise grace is no more grace; and if it be of grace it is not of works, otherwise work is no more work. Paul assures us that the two principles of grace and merit can no more mix together than fire and water; that if man is to be saved by the mercy of God, it must be by the mercy of God and not by works; but if man is to be saved by works, it must be by works entirely and not by mercy mixed therewith, for mercy and work will not go together. Jesus saves, but he does all the work or none. He is Author and Finisher, and works must not rob him of his due. Sinner, you must either receive salvation freely from the hand of Divine Bounty, or else you must earn it by your own unassisted merits, which last is utterly impossible. Oh that you would yield to the first! My brethren, this is the truth, which still needs to be preached. This is the truth, which shook all Europe from end to end when Luther first proclaimed it. Is not this the old thunderbolt which the great reformer hurled at Rome- \"Justified freely by his grace, through the redemption which is in Christ Jesus\"? But why did God make salvation to be by faith? Scripture tells us- \"Therefore it is of faith, that it might be by grace.\" If it had been by works it must have been by debt; but since it is by faith, we can clearly see that there can be no merit, in faith. It must be therefore by grace. \n" +
                "\n" +
                "4. My text is even more explicit yet, for the eternal purpose is mentioned. The next thing the apostle says is this: \"Who hath saved us, and called us with an holy calling, not according to our works but according to his own purpose.\" Mark that word- \"according to his own purpose.\" Oh how some people wriggle over that word, as if they were worms on a fisherman's hook! but there it stands, and cannot be got rid of. God saves his people \"according to his purpose,\" nay, \"according to his own purpose.\" My brethren and sisters, do you not see how all the merit and the power of the creature are shut out here, when you are saved, not according to your purpose or merit, but \"according to his own purpose\"? I shall not dwell on this; it is not exactly the object of this morning's discourse to bring out in full the great mystery of electing love, but I will not for a moment keep back the truth. If any man be saved, it is not because he purposed to be saved, but because God purposed to save him. Have ye never read the Holy Spirit's testimony: \"It is not of him that willeth, nor of him that runneth, but of God that showeth mercy\"? The Savior said to his apostles what he in effect says also to us, \"Ye have not chosen me, but I have chosen you, and ordained you, that ye might bring forth fruit.\" Some hold one and some another view concerning the freedom of the will, but our Savior's doctrine is, \"Ye will not come unto me that ye might have life.\" Ye will not come; your wills will never bring you; if ye do come, it is because grace inclined you. \"No man can come unto me, except the Father which hath sent me draw him.\" \"Whosoever cometh to me I will in no wise cast out,\" is a great and precious general text, but it is quite consistent with the rest of the same verse- \"All that the Father giveth me shall come to me.\" Our text tells us that our salvation is \"according to his own purpose.\" It is a strange thing that men should be so angry against the purpose of God. We ourselves have a purpose; we permit our fellow creatures to have some will of their own, and especially in giving away their own goods; but my God is to be bound and fettered by men, and not permitted to do as he wills with his own. But be this known unto ye, O men that reply against God, that he giveth no account of his matters, but asks of you, \"Can I not do as I will with mine own?\" He ruleth in heaven, and in the armies of this lower world, and none can stay his hand or say unto him, \"What doest thou?\" \n" +
                "\n" +
                "5. But then the text, lest we should make any mistake, adds, \"according to his own purpose and grace.\" The purpose is not founded on foreseen merit, but upon grace alone. It is grace, all grace, nothing but grace from first to last. Man stands shivering outside, a condemned criminal, and God sitting upon the throne, sends the herald to tell him that he is willing to receive sinners and to pardon them. The sinner replies, \"Well, I am willing to be pardoned if I am permitted to do something in order to earn pardon. If I \n" +
                "\n" +
                "can stand before the King and claim that I have done something to win his favor, I am quite willing to come.\" But the herald replies, \"No: if you are pardoned, you must understand it is entirely and wholly as an act of grace on God's part. He sees nothing good in you, he knows that there is nothing good in you; he is willing to take you just as you are, black, and bad, and wicked, and undeserving; he is willing to give you graciously what he would not sell to you, and what he knows you cannot earn of him. Will you have it?\" and naturally every man says, \"No, I will not be saved in that style.\" Well, then, soul, remember that thou wilt never be saved at all, for God's way is salvation by grace. You will have to confess if ever you are saved, my dear hearer, that you never deserved one single blessing from the God of grace; you will have to give all the glory to his holy name if ever you get to heaven. And mark you, even in the matter of the acceptance of this offered mercy, you will never accept it unless he makes you willing. He does freely present it to every one of you, and he honestly bids you come to Christ and live; but come you never will, I know, except the effectual grace which first provided mercy shall make you willing to accept that mercy. So the text tells us it is his own purpose and grace. \n" +
                "\n" +
                "6. Again, in order to shut out everything like boasting, the whole is spoken of as a gift. Do notice that; lest (for we are such straying sheep in this matter)-lest we should still slip out of the field, it is added, \"purpose and grace which he gave us\" -not \"which he sold us,\" \"offered us,\" but \"which he gave us.\" He must have a word here which shall be a death-blow to all merit,- \"which he gave us\" -it was given; and what can be freer than a gift, and what more evidently of grace? \n" +
                "\n" +
                "7. But the gift is bestowed through a medium, which glorifies Christ. It is written, \"which was given us in Christ Jesus.\" We ask to have mercy from the well-head of grace, but we ask not even to make the bucket in which it is to be brought to us; Christ is to be the sacred vessel in which the grace of God is to be presented to our thirsty lips. Now where is boasting? Why surely there it sits at the foot of the cross and sings, \"God forbid that I should glory save in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ.\" Is it not grace and grace alone? \n" +
                "\n" +
                "8. Yet further, a period is mentioned and added- \"before the world began.\" Those last words seem to me for ever to lay prostrate all idea of anything of our own merits in saving ourselves, because it is here witnessed that God gave us grace \"before the world began.\" Where were you then? What hand had you in it \"before the world began?\" Why, fly back if you can in imagination to the ancient years when those venerable mountains, that elder birth of nature, were not yet formed; when world, and sun, and moon, and stars, were all in embryo in God's great mind; when the unnavigated sea of space had never been disturbed by wing of seraph, and the awful silence of eternity had never been startled by the song of cherubim-when God dwelt alone. If you can conceive that time before all time, that vast eternity-it was then he gave us grace in Christ Jesus. What, O soul, hadst thou to do with that? Where were thy merits then? Where wast thou thyself? O thou small dust of the balance, thou insect of a day, where wert thou? See how Jehovah reigned, dispensing mercy as he would, and ordaining unto eternal life without taking counsel of man or angel, for neither man or angel then had an existence. That it might be all of grace he gave us grace before the world began. \n" +
                "\n" +
                "I have honestly read out the doctrine of the text, and nothing more. If such is not the meaning of the text I do not know the meaning of it, and I cannot therefore tell you what it is, but I believe that I have given the natural and grammatical teaching of the text. If you do not like the doctrine why I cannot help it. I did not make the text, and if I have to expound it I must expound it honestly as it is in my Master's Word, and I pray you to receive what he says whatever you may do with what I say. \n" +
                "\n" +
                "II. I shall want your patience while I try to SHOW THE USES OF THIS DOCTRINE. \n" +
                "\n" +
                "The doctrine of grace has been put by in the lumber chamber. It is acknowledged to be true, for it is confessed in most creeds; it is in the Church of England articles, it is in the confessions of all sorts of Protestant Christians, except those who are avowedly Arminian, but how little is it ever preached! It is put among the relics of the past. It is considered to be a respectable sort of retired officer, who is not expected to see any more active service. Now I believe that it is not a superannuated officer in the Master's army, but that it is as full of force and vigor as ever. But what is the use of it? Why, first then, it is clear from the connection that it has a tendency to embolden the man who receives it. Paul tells Timothy not to be ashamed, and he gives this as a motive:-How can a man be ashamed when he believes that God has given him grace in Christ Jesus before the world was? Suppose the man to be very poor. \"Oh,\" says he, \"what matters it? Though I have but a little oil in the cruse, and a little meal in the barrel, yet I have a lot and a portion in everlasting things. My name is not in Doomsday Book nor in Burke's Peerage; but it is in the book of God's election, and was there before the world began.\" Such a man dares look the proudest of his fellows in the face. This was the doctrine on which the brave old Ironsides fed; the men who, when they rode to battle with the war-cry of \"The Lord of hosts!\" made the cavaliers fly before them like chaff before the wind. No doctrine like it for putting a backbone into a man, and making him feel that he is made for something better than to be trodden down like straw for the dunghill beneath a despot's heel. Sneer who will, the elect of God derive a nobility from the divine choice which no royal patent can outshine. \n" +
                "\n" +
                "I would that free grace were more p reached, because it gives men something to believe with confidence. The great mass of professing Christians know nothing of doctrine; their religion consists in going a certain number of times to a place of worship, but they have no care for truth one way or another. I speak without any prejudice in this matter; but I have talked with a large number of persons in the course of my very extensive pastorate, who have been for years members of other churches, and when I have asked them a few questions upon doctrinal matters it did not seem to me that they were in error; they were perfectly willing to believe almost anything that any earnest man might teach them, but they did not know anything, they had no minds of their own, and no definite opinions. Our children, who have learned \"The Westminster Assembly's Confession of Faith,\" know more about the doctrines of grace and the doctrine of the Bible than hundreds of grown-up people who attend a ministry, which very eloquently teaches nothing. It was observed by a very excellent critic not long ago, that if you were to hear thirteen lectures on astronomy or geology, you might get a pretty good idea of what the science was, and the theory of the person who gave the lectures; but that if you were to hear thirteen hundred sermons from some ministers, you would not know at all what they were preaching about or what their doctrinal sentiments were. It ought not to be so. Is not this the reason why Puseyism spreads so, and all sorts of errors have such a foothold, because our people as a whole do not know what they believe? The doctrines of the gospel, if well received, give to a man something which he knows and which he holds and which will become dear to him, for which he would be prepared to die if the fires of persecution were again kindled. \n" +
                "\n" +
                "Better still is it that this doctrine not only gives the man something to hold but it holds the man. Let a man once have burnt into him that salvation is of God and not of man, and that God's grace is to be glorified and not human merit, and you will never get that belief out of him; it is the rarest thing in all the world to hear of such a man ever apostatizing from his faith. Other doctrine is slippery ground, like the slope of a mountain composed of loose earth and rolling stones, down which the traveler may slide long before he can even get a transient foothold; but this is like a granite step upon the eternal pyramid of truth; get your feet on this, and there is no fear of slipping so far as doctrinal standing is concerned. If we would have our churches in England well instructed and holding fast the truth, we must bring out the grand old verity of the eternal purpose of God in Christ Jesus before the world began. Oh may the Holy Spirit write it on our hearts! \n" +
                "\n" +
                "Moreover, my brethren, this doctrine overwhelms as with an avalanche all the claims of priest craft. Let it be told to men that they are saved by God, and they say at once, \"Then what is the good of the priest?\" If they are told it is God's grace then they say, \"Then you do not want our money to buy masses and absolutions,\" and down goes the priest at once. Beloved, this is the battering ram that God uses with which to shake the gates of hell. How much more forcible than the pretty essays of many divines, which have no more power than bulrushes, no more light than smoking flax. What do you suppose people used to meet in woods for in persecuting times, meet by thousands outside the town of Antwerp, and such-like places on the Continent, in jeopardy of their lives? Do you suppose they would ever have come together to hear that poor milk-and-water theology of this age, or to receive the lukewarm milk and water of our modern anti-Calvinists? Not they, my brethren. They needed stronger meat, and more savoury diet to attract them thus. Do you imagine that when it was death to listen to the preacher, that men under the shadows of night, and amid the wings of tempest would then listen to philosophical essays, or to mere moral precepts, or to diluted, adulterated, soul-less, theological suppositions? No, there is no energy in that kind of thing to draw men together under fear of their lives. But what did bring them together in the dead of night amidst the glare of lightning, and the roll of thunder-what brought them together? Why, the doctrine of the grace of God, the doctrine of Jesus, and of his servants Paul, and Augustine, and Luther, and Calvin; for there is something in that doctrine which touches the heart of the Christian, and gives him food such as his soul loveth, savoury meat, suitable to his heaven-born appetite. To hear this men braved death, and defied the sword. And it we are to see once again the scarlet hat plucked from the wearer's head, and the shaven crowns with all the gaudy trumpery of Rome sent back to the place from whence they came-and Heaven grant that they may take our Puseyite Established Church with them-it must be by declaring the doctrines of the grace of God. When these are declared and vindicated in every place, we shall yet again make these enemies of God and man to know that they cannot stand their ground for a moment, where men of God wield the sword of the Lord and of Gideon by preaching the doctrines of the grace of God. \n" +
                "\n" +
                "Brethren, let the man receive these truths; let them be written in his heart by the Holy Spirit, and they will make him look up. He will say, \"God has saved me!\" and he will walk with a constant eye to God. He will not forget to see the hand of God in nature and in providence; he will, on the contrary, discern the Lord working in all places, and will humbly adore him. He will not give to laws of nature or schemes of state the glory due to the Most High, but will have respect unto the unseen Ruler. \"What the Lord saith to me that will I do,\" is the believer's language. \"What is his will that will I follow; what is his word, that will I believe; what is his promise, on that I will live.\" It is a blessed habit to teach a man to look up, look up to God in all things. \n" +
                "\n" +
                "At the same time this doctrine makes a man look down upon himself. \"Ah,\" saith he, \"I am nothing, there is nothing in me to merit esteem. I have no goodness of my own. If saved, I cannot praise myself; I cannot in any way ascribe to myself honor; God has done it, God has done it.\" Nothing makes the man so humble; but nothing makes him so glad; nothing lays him so low at the mercy seat, but nothing makes him so brave to look his fellow man in the face. It is a grand truth: would God ye all knew its mighty power! \n" +
                "\n" +
                "Lastly, this precious truth is full of comfort to the sinner, and that is why I love it. As it has been preached by some it has been exaggerated and made into a bugbear. Why, there are some who preach the doctrine of election as though it were a line of sharp pikes to keep a sinner from coming to Christ, as though it were a sharp, glittering halbert to be pushed into the breast of a coming sinner to keep him from mercy. Now it is not so. Sinner, whoever you may be, wherever you may be, your greatest comfort should be to know that salvation is by grace. Why man, if it were by merit, what would become of you? Suppose that God saved men on account of their merits, where would you drunkards be? where would you swearers be? you who have been unclean and unchaste, and you whose hearts have cursed God, and who even now do not love him, where would you be? But when it is all of grace, why then all your past life, however black and filthy it may be, need not keep you from coming to Jesus. Christ receiveth sinners, God has elected sinners; he has elected some of the blackest of sinners-why not you? He receives every one that comes to him. He will not cast you out. There have been some who have hated him, insulted him to his face, that have burned his servants alive, and have persecuted him in his members, but as soon as even they have cried, \"God be merciful to me a sinner,\" he has given them mercy at once, and he will give it to you if you be led to seek it. If I had to tell you that you were to work out your own salvation apart from his grace it were a sad look-out for you, but when it comes to you thus: black, there is washing for you! dead! there is life for you! naked! there is raiment for you! All undone and ruined! here is a complete salvation for you! O soul, mayest thou have grace to lay hold of it, and then thou and I together will sing to the praise of the glory of divine grace. \n", "C. H. SPURGEON",

They talk about heaven like the air. Now there would not have been so much in Scripture on this subject if God had wanted to leave the human race in darkness about it, All Scripture, we are told, is given by inspiration of God, and is profitable for doctrine, for reproof, for correction, for instruction in righteousness, that the man of God may be perfect - thoroughly furnished unto all good works. What the Bible says about heaven, is just as true as what it says about everything else. It is inspired. What we are taught about heaven could not have come to us in any other way but by inspiration. No one knew anything about it but God, and so if we want to find out anything about it, we have to turn to His Word. Dr. Hodge, of Princeton, says that the best evidence of the Bible being the word of God, is to be found between its own two covers. It proves itself. In this respect it like Christ, whose character proclaimed the divinity of His person. Christ showed himself more than man by what he did. The Bible shows itself more than a human book by what it says. It is not, however, because the Bible is written with more than human skill, far surpassing Shakespeare or any other human author, and that its knowledge of character and the eloquence it contains are beyond the powers of man; that we believe it to be inspired. \n" +
                "\n" +
                "Men's ideas differ about the extent that human skill call go; but the reason why we believe the Bible is inspired, is so simple that the humblest child of God can comprehend it. If the proof of its divine origin lay in its wisdom alone, a simple and uneducated man might not be able to believe it. We believe it is inspired, because there is nothing in it that could not have come from God. God is wise, and God is good. There is nothing in the, Bible that. is not wise, and there is nothing in it that is not good. If the Bible had anything in it that was opposed to reason, or to our sense of right, then, perhaps, we might think that it was like all the books in the world that are written merely by me. Books that are just human books, like merely human lives, have in them a great deal that is foolish and a great deal that is wrong. The life of Christ alone was perfect, being both human and divine, Not one of the other volumes, like the Koran, that claim divinity of origin, agree with common sense. There is nothing at all in the Bible that does not conform to common sense. What it tells us about the world having been destroyed by a deluge, and Noah and his family alone being saved, is no more wonderful than what is being taught in the schools, that all of the earth we see now, and everything upon it came out of a ball of fire. It is a great deal easier to believe that, man was made after the image of God, than it is to believe, as some young men and women are being taught now, that he was once a monkey. \n" +
                "\n" +
                "Like all the other wonderful works of God, this Book bears the sure stamp of its author. It is like Him. Though man plants the seeds, God makes the flowers, and they are perfect and beautiful like Himself. Men wrote what is in the Bible, but the work is God's. The more refined, as a rule, people are, the fonder they are of the flowers, and the better they are, as a rule, the more they love the Bible. \n" +
                "\n" +
                "The fondness for flowers refines people, and the love of the Bible makes them better. All that is in the Bible about God, about man, about redemption, and about a future state, agrees with our own ideas of right, with our reasonable fears and with our personal experiences. All the historical things are told in the way that we know the world had of looking at them when they were written. What the Bible tells about heaven is not half so strategic as what Professor Proctor tells about the hosts of stars that are beyond the range of any telescope - yet people very often think that science is all fact, and that religion is only fancy. A great, many persons think that Jupiter and many more of the stars around us are inhabited, who cannot bring themselves to believe that there is a life beyond this earth for immortal souls. The true Christian puts faith before reason, and believes that reason always goes wrong when faith is set aside. If people would but read their Bibles more, and study what there is to be found there about Heaven, they would not be as worldly minded as they are. They would not have their hearts set upon things down here, but would seek the imperishable things above. \n" +

How we wonder if we will ever see them again, and where and when it will be!

                "\n" +
                "Look at the cities of the past. There is Babylon. It was founded by a woman named Semiramis, who had two millions of men at work for years building it. It is nothing but dust now. Nearly a thousand years ago, some historian wrote that the ruins of Nebuchadnezzar's palace were still standing, but men were afraid to go near them because they were full of scorpions and snakes. That's the Sort of ruin that greatness often comes to in our own day. Nineveh is gone. Its towers and bastions have fallen. The traveler who tries to see Carthage, can't see much of it. Corinth, once the seat of luxury and art, is only a shapeless mass. Ephesus long the metropolis of Asia, the Paris of that day, was crowded with buildings as large as the capitol at Washington. I am told it looks more like a neglected graveyard now than anything else. Granada is now the housing place of lions and jackals. It was once very grand, with its twelve gates and towers. The Alhambra, the palace of the Mohammedan kings, was situated there. Probably the animals play with the monarchs' bones. Little pieces of the once grand and beautiful cities of Herculanaeum and Pompeii are now being sold in the shops for relics. Jerusalem, once one of the grandest cities of the universe, is but a shadow of itself. Thebes - for thousands of years, up almost to the coming of Christ, the largest and wealthiest city of the world - is now a mass of decay. Very little of Athens and many more of the proud cities of olden times, remain to tell the story of their downfall. God drives His plowshare through cities, and they are upheaved like furrows in the field. \"Behold,\" says Isaiah, \"the nations are as a drop of a bucket, and are counted as the small dust of the balance; behold, he taketh up the isles as a very little thing. All nations before him are as nothing, and they are counted to him less than nothing, and vanity.\" \n" +
                "\n" +
                "See how Antioch has fallen! When Paul preached there it was a superb metropolis. A wide street, over three miles long, stretching across the entire city, was ornamented with rows of columns and covered galleries, and at every corner stood carved statues to commemorate their great men, whose names even we have never heard. These are never heard of now, but the poor preaching tent-maker who came into its portals, stands out as the grandest character in all history. The finest specimens of Grecian art decorated the shrines of the temples, and the baths and the aqueducts were such as are never approached in elegance now. Men then, as now, were seeking honors and wealth and mighty names, and seeking to enshrine their names and records in perishable clay. Within the walls, we are told, were enclosed mountains over seven hundred feet high, and rocky precipices and deep ravines gave wild and picturesque character to the, city of which no modern city gives us an example, These heights were fortified in a marvelous manner, which gave to them strange startling effects. The vast population of this brilliant city, combining all the art and cultivation of Greece with the levity, the luxury and the superstition of Asia, was as intent on pleasure as the population of any of our great cities are to-day. They had their shows, their games, their races and dances, their sorcerers, puzzlers, buffoons and miracle-workers, and the whole people sought constantly in the theatres and processions, for something to stimulate and gratify the most corrupt desires of the soul. \n" +
                "\n" +
                "This is pretty much what we find the masses of the people in our great cities doing now. The place was even worse than Athens, for the so-called worship they indulged in was not only idolatrous, but had mixed up with it the grossest passions to which man descends. It was here that Paul it came to preach the glad tidings of Christ; it was here that his converts were first called Christians, as a nickname; the first time the name, was ever used, all followers of Christ before time having been called \"saints \" or \"brethren.\" As has been well said, out of that spring at Antioch, a mighty stream has flowed to water the world. Astarte, the \"Queen of Heaven,\" whom they worshipped; Diana, Apollo, the Pharisee and Sadusee, are no more, but the despised Christians yet live. Yet that Heathen City, which would not take Christianity to its heart and keep it, fell. Cities that have not the refining and restraining influences of Christianity well established in them, seldom do amount to much in the long ran. They grow dim in the light of ages. Few of our great cities in this country are a hundred years old as yet. For nearly a thousand years this city prospered; yet it fell. \n" +

                "I do not think that it is wrong for us to think and talk about heaven. I like to locate, heaven, and find out all I about it. I expect to live there through all eternity If I was going to dwell in any place in this country, if I was going to make it my home, I would want to inquire about the place, about its climate, about the neighbors I would have, and about everything in fact, that I could learn concerning it. If any of you were going to emigrate, that would be the way you would feel. Well, we are all going to emigrate in a very little while to a country that is very far away. We are going to spend eternity in another world a grand and glorious world where God reigns. Is it riot natural, then, that we should look and listen and try to find out who is already there, and what is the route to take? Soon after I was converted, an infidel asked me one day why I looked up when I prayed. He said that heaven was no more above as than below us; that heaven was everywhere. Well, I was greatly bewildered, and the next time I prayed, it seemed almost as if I was praying into the air. Since then I have become better acquainted with the Bible, and I have come to see that heaven is above us; that it is upward and not downward. The spirit of God is everywhere, but God is in heaven, and heaven is above our heads. It does not matter what part of the globe we may stand upon, heaven, is above us. \n" +
                "\n" +
                "In Genesis 17, it says that God went up from Abraham; and in John 3, that he came down from heaven. So, in Acts 1, we find that Christ went up into heaven (not down), and a cloud received him out of sight, Thus we see heaven is up. The very arrangement of the firmament about the earth declares the, seat of God's glory to be above us. Job says, \"Let not God regard it from above,\" and we find the Psalmist declaring, \"the Lord is high above nations, and His glory above the heavens.\" \n" +
                "\n" +
                "Again in Deuteronomy, we find, \"who shall go up for us to heaven?\" Thus, all through scripture we find that we are given the location of heaven as upward and beyond the firmament. This firmament, with its many bright worlds scattered through, is so vast that heaven must be an extensive realm. Yet this need not surpass us. \n" +

                "In Jeremiah 51, we are told that: He hath made the earth by his power; he hath established the world by his wisdom, and hath stretched out the heaven by his understanding. Yet, how little we really know of that power, or wisdom or understanding! As it says in Job 26, Lo, these are parts of his ways: but how little a portion is heard of him? But the thunder of his power, who can understand? \n" +
                "\n" +
                "This is the word of God. As we find in Isa 42:5, Thus saith God the Lord, he that created the heavens and stretched them out; he that spread forth the earth, and that which cometh out of it; he that giveth bread unto the people upon it, and spirit to them that walk within. The discernment of God's power, the messages of heaven, do not always come in great things. We read in 1 Kings 19, \"And behold, the Lord passed by, and a great and strong wind rent the mountains, and brake in pieces the rocks before the Lord; but the Lord was not in the wind: and after the wind an earthquake; but the Lord was not in the earthquake: and after the earthquake a fire; but the Lord was not in the fire: and after the fire a still small voice.\" \n" +

                "Some people are trying to find out just how far heaven is away. There is one thing we know about it; that is, that it is not so far away but that God can hear us when we pray. I do not believe there has ever been a tear shed for sin since Adam's fall in Eden to the present time, but God has witnessed that. He is not too far from this earth for us to go to Him; and if there is a sigh that comes from a burdened heart to-day, God will hear that sigh. If there is a cry coming up from a heart broken on account of sin, God will hear that cry, He is not so far away, heaven is not so far away, as to be inaccessible to the smallest child. In 2Ch 7:14, we read: \"If my people, which are called by my name, shall humble themselves, and pray, and seek my face, and turn from their wicked ways, then will I hear from heaven, and will forgive their sins, and will heal, their land,\" \n" +

And someone asked him what he was doing, and he said he was trying to find out where his child had gone, and I think he was a reasonable man. I suppose there is not a man or woman but has dear ones that are gone. Shall we close this book to-day? Or shall we look into it to try to find where the loved ones are? I was reading, some time ago, and account of a father, a minister, who had lost a child. He had gone to a great many funerals, offering comfort to others in sorrow, but now the iron had entered his own soul, and a brother minister had come to officiate and preach the funeral sermon; and after the minister got through speaking, the father got up, and standing right at the head of the coffin, looking at the face of that loved child that was gone, he said that a few years ago, when he had first come into that parish, as he used to look over the river he took no interest in the people over there, because they were all strangers to him and there were none over there that belonged to his parish. But, he said , a few years ago a young man came into his home, and married his daughter, and she went over the river to live, and when that child went over there, he became suddenly interested in the inhabitants, and every morning as he would get up he would look out of the window and look over there at her home. But now, said he, another child has been taken. She has gone over another river, and heaven seems dearer and nearer to me than it ever has before. \n" +

It is for this that men are seeking everywhere; and yet, they can have it, if they will; but instead of looking down, they must look up to find it.

What was it that led Columbus, not knowing what would be his fate, across the unsailed western seas, if it was not the hope of finding a better country? This is was that sustained the hearts of the Pilgrim Fathers, driven from their native land by persecution, as they faced an iron-bound, savage coast, with an unexplored territory beyond.

                "It is said by travelers, that in climbing the Alps the houses of far distant villages can be seen with great distinctness, so that sometimes the number of panes of glass in a church window can be counted. The distance looks so short that the place seems almost at hand, but after hours and hours of climbing, it looks no nearer yet. This is because of the clearness of the atmosphere. By perseverance, however, the place is reached at last, and the tired traveler finds rest. So sometimes we dwell in high altitudes of grace; heaven seems very near, and the hills of Beulah are in full view. At other times the clouds and fogs that come through suffering and sin, cut off our sight. We are just as near heaven in the one case as we are in the other, and we are just as sure of gaining it if we only keep in the path that Christ has trod. \n" +

                "I have read that on the shores of the Adriatic sea, the wives of fishermen, whose husbands have gone far out upon the deep, are in the habit of going down to the seashore at night and singing with their sweet voices the first verse of some beautiful hymn, After they have sung it they listen until they hear brought on the wind, across the sea, the second verse sung by their brave husbands as they are tossed by the gale-and both are happy. Perhaps, if we would listen, we too might hear on this sea-tossed world of ours, some sound, some. whisper, borne from afar to tell us there is a heaven which is our home; and when we sing our hymns upon the shores of earth, perhaps we may hear their sweet echoes breaking in music upon the sands of time, and cheering the hearts of those who are pilgrims and strangers along the way. Yet we need to look up-out, beyond this low earth, and to build higher in our thoughts and actions, even here. \n" +

                "You know, when a man is going up in a balloon, he takes in sand as a ballast, and when he wants to mount a little higher, he throws out a little of the ballast, and then he will mount a little higher; he throws out a little more ballast, and he mounts still higher; and the higher he gets the more he throws out-and so the nearer we get to God the more we have to throw out of the things of this world. Let go of them; do not let us first set our hearts and affections on them, but do what the Master tells us_lay up for ourselves treasures in heaven. In England I was told of a lady who bad been bedridden for years. She was one of those saints that God polishes up for the kingdom; for I believe that there are a good many saints in this world that we never hear about; we never see their names heralded through the press; they live very near the Master; they live very near heaven; and I think it takes a great deal more grace to suffer God's will than it does to do God's will; and if a person lies on a bed of sickness, and suffers cheerfully, it is just as acceptable to God as if they went out and worked in his vineyard. \n" +

                "Now, it was One of those saints, and a lady, who said that for a long time she used to have a great deal of pleasure in watching a bird that came to make its nest near her window. One year it came to make its nest, and it began to make it so low she was afraid something would happen to the young; and every day that she saw that bird busy at work making its nest, she kept saying, \"O bird, build higher!\" She could that the bird was going to come to grief and disappointment. At last the bird got its nest done,, and laid its eggs and hatched its young; and every morning the lady looked out to see if the nest was there, and she saw the old bird bringing food for the little ones, and she took a great deal of pleasure in looking at it. But one morning she woke up and she looked out and she saw nothing but feathers scattered all around, and she said, \"Ah, the cat has got the old bird and all its young.\" It would have been a mercy to have torn that nest down. That is what God does for us very often_just snatches things away before it is to late. Now, I think that is what we want to say to church people_that if you build for time you will be disappointed. God says: Build up yonder. It is a good deal better to have life in Christ and God than any where else. I would rather have my life hid with Christ in God than be in Eden as Adam was. Adam might have remained in Paradise for 16,000 years, and then fallen, but if ours is hid in Christ, how safe! \n", "D. L. Moody",
